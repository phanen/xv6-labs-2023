## hack

since we know xv6 use a naive way (turn off the interrupt) to avoid interrupt acquire deadlock

run `make CPUS=1 qemu`
- `#test-and-set` is 0, since it can never be reached (lock-area is not interruptable...)
> that's the reason of: "For this lab, you must use a dedicated unloaded machine with multiple cores."

for multicore case...
- `#test-and-set` is roughly the spin times
- `#acquire` is still just `acquire` calling times
- so in nature, it's race of core but not process

implement per-CPU freelists, and stealing when a CPU's free list is empty

## why `cpuid` need to turn intr off...

cpuid read `tp`, which is initilzied as `mhartid`

`tp` will be switch between user/trap
```asm
# uservec
sd tp, 64(a0)
# make tp hold the current hartid, from p->trapframe->kernel_hartid
ld tp, 32(a0)
```
- but when bootstrap a process, its `trapframe->tp` is filled with `kalloc` junk
- so `tp` is nonsense for user, and only meaningful in trap...


what if you don't turn off intr, let's have a review on scheduling...
- you call `cpuid()`, load `tp` to variable, then timer interrupt
- current cpu go away -> `sched`(`swtch` to cpu) -> `scheduler`(`swtch` to another process)
- similarly, another cpu schedule back here, pick up this process(in trap)
  - now `tp` has changed

so why does it hurt?
- when `kfree`, we don't care about which cpu alloc mem from which freelist...
- but this way is very random, may cause much more contentions...
  - e.g. cpuB acquire mem of cpuA, if falled due to cpuA's mem run out, cpuC then steal it from cpuD...
- we can avoid it by
  - `push_off` before get cpuid
  - `pop_off` after this mem is allocated
  - then cpuB will acquire it's own mem first, then steal from cpuD

> annoying, we `push_off`, anyway
